MetaLearnPlasticity analyzes experimental data from the brain and behavior to discover the rules governing how neurons form and modify their connections (synaptic plasticity). It works by creating mathematical models of these plasticity rules and using gradient descent to find the model parameters that best explain how neural connections change during learning.

## üöÄ Features

- **Parameterized Plasticity Rules**  
  Models plasticity using Taylor series expansions or multilayer perceptrons for flexibility and interpretability.

- **Gradient Descent Optimization**  
  Optimizes parameters over entire trajectories to match observed neural or behavioral data.

- **Nonlinear Dependencies**  
  Capable of learning rules with intricate, nonlinear dependencies, such as postsynaptic activity and synaptic weights.

- **Simulation Validation**  
  Validates method by recovering known rules (e.g., Oja's rule) and exploring complex hypothetical rules.
